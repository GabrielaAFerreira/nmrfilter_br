Requirements are Java and Python. For Java, version 1.8 or higher is needed. A JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is enough, a JDK is not required. The default of any operating system should do.
 
Python version must be 3. You need numpy, scipy and igraph libraires. Using pip, you can install them by doing
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install igraph-python
pip3 install python-louvain
Notice igraph is a different library.
